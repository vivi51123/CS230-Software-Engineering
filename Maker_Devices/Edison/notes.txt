Running Valgrind on the Edison requires a few extra steps

Run the following steps
1.) opkg install valgrind  //you may get an error here regarding a new line.
If so, do the following:
1a.) cd /var/lib/opkg //Look for a file called iotdk-intel or intel-iotdk
1b.) vim iotdk-intel
1c.) //Go to end of file and add a new line (idk why this is an error) but
should work now (run opkg install valgrind again)

2.) opkg install libc6-dbg //can probably skim this step
3.) opkg install libc6 --force-reinstall //don't know why it has to be
reinstalled but will likely need to be.  had to be for my Edison

Now you're good to go to run Valgrind (memcheck)

Initial observation:
After running a simple memory leak test, I noticed that Valgrind on the Edison
takes substancially longer to run than on a laptop (which is expected).  But
long enough on a simple program (one possible mem leak, 41 LOC) that
scalability, is likely to become a big issue.
